// PART 1: printing with prompt
// Prompt the user for a number and cast it to a number
const user=prompt("enter a number and cast it to a number");
const userNumber=Number(userInput);

// Prompt the user for another number that is bigger than the first number and cast it to a number
const question=prompt("enter another number that is bigger than the first number and cast it to a number")

// Write a JavaScript program that uses a for loop to print all numbers from the first number to the second number

for(let i= firstNumber)





// PART 2: Averaging an array
// Create an array of numbers 
const numbers = [3,8,12,15,21,27,33,39];

// Write a for loop that calculates the sum of the elements 
for(let i = 0;i<numbers.length;i++){
  sum += numbers[i];
}
console.log("The sum of the elements is: " + sum);




// Using the sum, calculate the average of all the elements (sum divided by the length of the array)
const average= sum / numbers.length;
